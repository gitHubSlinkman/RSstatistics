knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Objective to test the fit_loess function

We first prepare the environment for the test. 

```{r prepare_envronment}
library( tidyverse )                    # I live in the tidyverse R-environment.
```

## Prepare data

We will be using the base R provided data set ##faithful##.  

I don't like the variable names I will change them.  I will also create a tibble names old_faithful. I do this because I think that variable names for statistical computing should be as descrptive as possible.

```{r prepare_test_data}
data(  )                       # Prepare data

waiting_time    <- faithful$waiting
eruption_length <- faithful$eruptions

old_faithful <- 
  tibble( eruption_length,
          waiting_time )

old_faithful
```

Note that all times are in minutes.
